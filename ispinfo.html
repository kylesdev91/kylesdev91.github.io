     <h1>Content:</h1>
    <p>We are planning to create a quiz game. The game to tests players general knowledge about the world</p>
    <h1>Motivation:</h1>
    <p>We want to design a game that everybody likes and learns something new out of it.</p>
    <h1>Code segments and explanations:</h1>
    <p>We had to make the questions not too hard or too easy
      Designing the theme for the questions, and
      making the background</p>
    <h1>Conclusions: What went as expected; what did not and why?</h1>
    <p>Expected: Everybody in the group had the access to the files in Github after creating in KQuiz directory.</p>
    <p>Problem 1: The KQuiz title was hidden under the background, with no way to show up. Solution 1: We had to render fill style and stroke style for the text to show up on the background</p>
<p>Problem 2: Another problem we faced is how to randomize the questions/numbers in the IGIS browser. Solution 2: Inside of BackgroundLayer.swift, we created a variable that stores a random number between 1 and 49.
  Then, we assigned the questionIndex to the variable randomQuestion instead of a fixed number.</p>
<p>Problem 3: We did not know how to code buttons in Swift.Solution 3: We imported Scenes Controls from Mr. Ben github codermerlin and made four buttons, one for each of the answer choices.</p>
<p>Problem 4: Words kept getting on top of each other when the next button is clicked. Solution 4: We decided to create ten clear buttons manually
  One for each question </p>
